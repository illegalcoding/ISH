# ISH
ISH (or Internet Scanner for HTTP) scans an assigned IP range on n threads for web servers that respond 200 OK to a simple HTTP GET request.\
It is written in C, and I've only tested it on OpenBSD so far. The code is a mess; it is has lots of debug statements, and in general isn't nice to look at.\
Too bad!
